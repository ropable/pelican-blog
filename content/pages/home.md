I'm Ashley Felton, a full-stack web developer and sysadmin based in Perth,
Western Australia. I mostly do backend and architecture, not so much UI. Does it
show? ;-)

These days I'm the stereotypical DevOps guy; I can generally keep the software
stack available and reliable (as long as we're using some variety of *nix). I
can manage the hardware too, but I prefer to steer clear of working with actual
physical hardware as much as possible. Lately I've become quite familar with,
and impressed by, Kubernetes.

I enjoy woodworking, strength training, powerlifting, rock climbing & bouldering,
marvelling at online subcultures, learning cool things on Hacker News, and
collecting and painting innumerable Warhammer 40000 armies.

The pronouns I use are he/him (this sentence might act as a Rorschach test about
whether you want to know me; I sincerely hope that it doesn't).
