Title: About me
Date: 2019-08-12 11:48

I'm Ashley Felton, a full-stack web developer and sysadmin based in Perth,
Western Australia. I mostly do backend and architecture, not so much UI. Does it
show? ;-)

I enjoy strength training, powerlifting, climbing & bouldering, marvelling at online
subcultures, learning things on Hacker News, and (lately) 8th-edition Warhammer
40000.

My email is this very domain, prepended with 'ashley'. I assume that most humans can
work that one out.
