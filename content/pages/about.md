Title: About me
Date: 2019-08-13 12:36

I'm Ashley Felton, a full-stack web developer and sysadmin based in Perth,
Western Australia. I mostly do backend and architecture, not so much UI. Does it
show? ;-)

These days I'm the stereotypical DevOps guy; I can generally keep the software
stack available and reliable (as long as we're using some variety of *nix). I
can manage the hardware too, but I prefer to steer clear of working with actual
physical hardware as much as possible. Weekend callouts to the data centre are a
distant, non-cherished memory.

I enjoy strength training, powerlifting, climbing & bouldering, marvelling at online
subcultures, learning things on Hacker News, and (lately) 8th-edition Warhammer
40000.
